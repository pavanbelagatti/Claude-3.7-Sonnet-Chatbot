## Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet Model
Anthropic recently announced [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), the first hybrid reasoning model. 
But before talking about Claude 3.7 Sonnet's performance, let's talk about reasoning models a little bit. 
It is well known that language models and other NLP models struggle with reasoning, especially multi-step reasoning. 
But these AI systems have evolved lately with the introduction of reasoning models. 

### So, What are Reasoning Models? 
Reasoning models are the LLMs designed to simulate a human-like thought process before finalizing an answer. Instead of producing an output immediately, they generate a hidden chain‐of‐thought—an internal, step‐by‐step breakdown of the problem—that helps them tackle complex tasks more accurately and deeply.
Reasoning models are important because they enable AI systems to tackle complex problems that require multi-step logical thinking.

#### The Examples of Reasoning Models Include:
- OpenAI’s o1 model 
- Anthropic’s Claude (with modes that allow extended, deliberative thinking),
- xAI’s Grok 3 (which offers multiple reasoning modes), and
- DeepSeek R1 (a cost-effective model emphasizing multi-step reasoning).

#### So, Why are We Talking about the Reasoning Models? 
Because Anthropic just made their biggest announcement in a while with the release of Claude 3.7 Sonnet. An advanced reasoning model.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic’s most advanced AI model, featuring hybrid reasoning, state-of-the-art coding capabilities, and an extended 200K context window.
These features make it one of the best models today. 

The interesting thing is, Claude 3.7 Sonnet introduces Thinking Mode, which lets us see the model’s thought process. 
Let's see Claude 3.7 Sonnet's performance and capabilities through a simple experiment.
